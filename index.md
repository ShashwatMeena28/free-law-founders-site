# The Free Law Founders

### *Citizens, technologists and public officials working together to transform state & local lawmaking for the 21st Century*

#### The Free Law Founders is a nation-wide, collaborative effort open to all people who want to improve how laws and legislation are produced and presented to citizens of American states and cities.  Our goal is to modernize how democracy works in the United States from the ground up.  To get there, we're creating open source tools and open data formats government workers need to get their jobs done efficiently, effectively and accountably.  And we're building digital democracy platforms so citizens can finally access legislative information online in user-friendly, interactive formats that make sense.  And we're making all of our work available on the Internet for any community to reuse at no cost.    


A massive effort is needed to upgrade our legislatures and legal data.  No one city or state or private company can succeed alone.  But everyone is paying the price for the inefficient, opaque and costly ways we make laws today.  That's why we're coming together to contribute our time, our talents and our energy to the Free Law Founders, bringing the results back to legislatures where we live and work.  

We believe every citizen and every government worker deserves the benefits of digital-first democracy.  And we believe that everyone has a role to play in the Free Law Founders reinvention of government of the people, by the people and for the people.  Won't you [join us](http://eepurl.com/Yu7fr)?

Open Government Leaders Across the U.S. Announce Formation of the “Free Law Founders”
San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, Boston, and Washington D.C. come together to form open government coalition dedicated to bringing legislative information free to the people 

(NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, BOSTON, CHICAGO, WASHINGTON D.C.) -  Open government leaders from across the country led by New York City Council Member Ben Kallos, San Francisco Supervisor Mark Farrell and Seamus Kraft of Open Government Foundation, today announced the formation of the Free Law Founders (FLF), a coalition of digital democracy leaders formed to bring government to the people. The group was founded on the principle that the law is no longer sufficiently accessible to residents through modern tools, in large part because of private software organizations and inefficient bureaucracy. The FLF has already been working to bring legislative information for free to residents across the country in human- and machine-readable formats, so that people can access, use, and engage with the laws, codes, and policies of their cities and country. 

A central project of the organization, the Free Law Founders Challenge aims to create a free and open source digital platform for government and residents that will allow for democratic engagement through: 

·        Drafting legislation;  
·        Commenting on legislation;  
·        Making it available over open API;  
·        Open law online with comment to iterate the legislative process; and  
·        Authentication of legislation and law.  

The website is slated to have a minimum viable product complete in the fall. 
 
The Free Law Founders has founding representatives from the Sunlight Foundation, the MIT Center for Civic Media, Chicago’s Clerk’s Office, Boston’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, Washington D.C.’s City Attorney’s office, and – with more members soon to join.

“I have been leader here at the Board of Supervisors in advancing open data policies and open government initiatives, and I’m proud to serve as a founding member of the Free Law Founders to advance the goals of open legislation, so that we can continue to modernize our democracy and find better ways to build and maintain civic engagement with our residents” said Supervisor Mark Farrell. “Laws and legislative information are often overlooked as open data, and I believe laws and legislative information are one of, if not, the most important data sets government keep. As legislators we should do everything in our power to ensure laws, codes, and policies are free and easily accessible to our residents.”

“The law must be free. The government must belong to the people, and with it the source code that operates and improves legislation and laws,” said Council Member Ben Kallos. “Millenia ago, Hammurabi codified law and displayed it publicly for the people to see. Today, public means free and online, not behind a license or paywall.” 

The Free Law Founders takes the country’s open data movement into city government, where it can have a direct impact on millions of Americans. The goals of the Free Law Founders are to build cities and states across the country where citizens can: 

1.	Access Complete, Timely, Machine-Processable and Primary Laws, Legal Codes and Legislation on the Internet without facing restrictions, paywalls, fees, or burdensome user agreements;      
2.	Download, share, annotate, and reuse that legal data in non-proprietary, open formats that are both license-free and copyright-free;    
3.	See and participate in the lawmaking process on the Internet utilizing the latest open-source software, on their own time and on their own terms;    
4.	Freely engage with the law, and connect with their elected officials, other citizens and community stakeholders to collaboratively create and modify the laws when they want and how they want; and    
5.	Expect that all those involved in lawmaking are committed to injecting innovation, iteration and improvement into their work.    
 
The Free Law Founders have already begun to build upon and implement these goals with Supervisor Farrell’s legislation to make San Francisco the first “open legislation” city in the country, his change in city law that stemmed from direct constituent feedback, and his ReimagineSF initiative. 

Councilmember Kallos has introduced landmark open information legislation, including eNotices Act, Public Online Information Act, Free and Open Source Software Preferences Act, Civic Commons Legislation Act, and his City Record Online Act of 2014. 


They have advanced the principles of open legislation through an open letter (link to final), with the City Clerk of Chicago Susana Mendoza, calling on Granicus to develop an open API and conversion tool which will help each City host and publish their legislative information in machine-readable formats so developers can create apps with city legislative information.

The Free Law Founders will continue to work with elected officials, government workers, and civic technologists across the country to continue to advance the principles of open legislation, and will not stop until all cities and states across the country can enjoy the benefits of living in more informed, engaged, Free Law communities.

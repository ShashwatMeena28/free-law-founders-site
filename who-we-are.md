    <section class="content">
      <p>
        For over a decade, Charles has worked in Ward 6 neighborhoods – helping bring about school reforms, working with small businesses, and improving our community. His years of public service to Ward 6 means he knows and understands neighborhood issues like no one else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charles Allen began his career in the District as a graduate fellow with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to work on expanding community-based health options across the nation. Charles quickly understood that to make true change he needed to return to his roots working at the local and community level. So Charles began his service to the District as policy director for the DC Primary Care Association, where he helped bring about legislative, budget, and policy changes that expanded health care options for almost every DC resident. Two of his signature efforts – bringing physicians, dentists, nurses and other healthcare providers to medically underserved communities and creating a District-owned captive insurance company to provide free and low-cost medical malpractice insurance to non-profit providers – remain a vital part of the city’s health care safety net nearly a decade after he helped create them.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Charles helped found DC for Democracy and served as Chair of the organization to bring a needed voice for progressive priorities and social justice issues facing the city. Today, DC for Democracy is a leading voice in the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences led Charles to become an elected delegate for the District at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, and later serve as President of the Ward 6 Democrats. Ultimately, he served as chief of staff to Ward 6 Councilmember Tommy Wells, a position he held since Wells first took office in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charles graduated from Washington and Lee University and received a master’s degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In addition to his local political activism managing Wells’ successful Ward 6 campaigns, he has been involved in progressive national campaigns.

        In his eight years in the D.C. Council, Tommy Wells won support throughout the District for his vision of a livable and walkable city for all. He was and remains a passionate advocate for innovative solutions, and D.C.’s leading voice for progressive change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tommy started his Washington career in 1983 as a social worker in the D.C. foster care system.  In 1991, he took the helm of the D.C. Consortium for Child Welfare, where he was a force for creating neighborhood based-family service collaboratives that coordinate the delivery of city and nonprofit resources. During his 15 years with the Consortium, Tommy also served as an ANC Commissioner from 1994 to 2000 and a member of the D.C. Board of Education, representing Wards 5 and 6, from 2000 to 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since joining the DC Council in January 2007, Tommy has been a tireless advocate for smart growth and social justice. He spearheaded efforts to ensure that transit prioritized connecting neighborhoods to give DC residents access to jobs, instead of just moving commuters in and out of the city. He led the way in establishing the Housing First program, a proven way to get homeless people back on track by providing a stable place to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his last term, Tommy chaired the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety. As Chair, he has championed landmark legislation to decriminalize marijuana possession and “ban the box” in private sector hiring, giving returning citizens equal opportunities for success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tommy is the former chair of the board for Jan's Tutoring House and the previous chair of the Local Government Advisory Committee for the Chesapeake Bay. He graduated from the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University in 1991 and earned a master's degree in social work from the University of Minnesota in 1983. Since 1988 he has been married to Barbara Wells, a writer and arts enthusiast who is a tutor for Jan's Tutoring House and a judge for the Helen Hayes Awards.

        James Turk is a Developer and Open Source Coordinator for the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/), a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that advocates for open government globally and uses technology to make government more accountable to all.  He leads Sunlight's [Open States](http://openstates.org/) and [Open Civic Data](http://opencivicdata.org/) projects in efforts to collect and standardize US state and local legislative information. Open States is a collection of tools that make it possible for citizens to track what is happening in their state's capitol by aggregating information from all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The Sunlight Foundation, too, has built off of its Open States work to create an Open Civic Data Schema for bills, events, and votes and adopted people and organization schemas that are compatible with the [Popolo format](http://popoloproject.com/). These formats are compatible with all levels of government and with identifiers that power [Google’s Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/us_v1/representatives/representativeInfoQuery).
      </p>

        James earned his Bachelor of Science in computer science from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2008. Before joining the Sunlight Foundation Labs team, he also spent time working at Project Vote Smart.  <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/team/">Website</a>

        Oklahoma State Representative Jason Murphey has repeatedly championed the cause of using technology to open up the government to the people. In 2001, as a member of his local city council, he sponsored resolutions to place government proceedings on television and the Internet and to make the city code available online for all to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2006, as a state legislator, he has sponsored successful legislation to open up access to government spending and performance data, created the data.ok.gov and documents.ok.gov web portals and removed statutory barriers to government agency use of social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2014, Murphey was designated as one of Government Technology magazine’s top 25 Doers, Dreamers and Drivers. Government Technology also named Murphey as one of the nation’s 13 most tech-savvy legislators.

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      The Free Law Founders (FLF) is a nationwide partnership of local elected officials, non-profit software developers, educators, and city attorneys dedicated to upgrading how citizens can access Americaâ€™s laws, legislation, and the lawmaking process itself on the Internet.  We're creating and sharing the modern tools, data standards and processes our state and local governments need to meet the growing challenges of democracy in the Internet Age.  Everyone can join.  Everyone has something to contribute.  And everyone in our democracy can benefit.  Here's what joining the FLF means for you &mdash; <a href="http://bit.ly/1mM1ZVe">sign up today!</a>

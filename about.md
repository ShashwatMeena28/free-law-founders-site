  ### The Principles of Open Law & Open Legislation

  Any citizen living in a Free Law community should be able to:

  1. Access Complete, Timely, Machine-Processable and Primary Laws, Legal Codes and Legislation on the Internet without facing restrictions, paywalls, fees, or burdensome user agreements.

  2. Download, share, annotate, and reuse that legal data in non-proprietary, open formats that are both license- and copyright-free.

  3. See and participate in the lawmaking process on the Internet utilizing the latest open-source software, on their own time and on their own terms.

  4. Freely engage with the law, and connect with their elected officials, other citizens and community stakeholders to collaboratively create and modify the laws when they want and how they want.

  5. Expect that all those involved in lawmaking are committed to injecting innovation, iteration and improvement into their work.

The Free Law Founders (FLF) is a nation-wide partnership of local elected officials, non-profit software developers, educators, and city attorneys dedicated to upgrading how citizens can access America’s laws, legislation, and the lawmaking process itself on the Internet. The Founders have accepted the challenge of creating the modern tools, data standards and processes our state and local governments need to meet the growing challenges of democracy in the Internet Age. The FLF is open to anyone willing to help accomplish these goals across the country. [Sign up today!](http://bit.ly/1mM1ZVe)

### Declaration of Independence of Law

“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,” that laws are “wholesome and necessary for the public good,” that ignorantia juris non excusat “is a maxim of universal application that every man is presumed to know the law, and it would seem inherent that freedom of access to the laws, or the official interpretation of those laws, should be co-extensive with the sweep of the maxim. Knowledge is the only just condition of obedience,” that “such material as the laws and governmental rules and decisions must be freely available to the public and made known as widely as possible; hence there must be no restriction on the reproduction and dissemination of such documents.”

We believe that our system of government is no longer free for the governed to access in the method of our times. And we, the Free Law Founders, have come together to tackle this growing challenge to democracy in America the American way: with innovation, with collaboration, and with a firm belief that in our country, better is always possible.

### The Current State of Affairs

Some reasons behind the formation of the Free Law Founders:

#### Chicago, Illinois: The Process of Legislation and Codification


* There are approximately 11 Council meetings per year.
* Each Council meeting, over 11,000 pages are introduced and referred to a committee. Document types include ordinances, orders, appointments, resolutions, and the supporting documentation for each. We PDF, redact, and post all non-private information on the Legislative Information System within 48 hours of introduction. Next, the Clerk’s Office distributes the original (unredacted) to the appropriate committees for consideration, modification, and recommendation.
* In the following weeks, committees return over 10,000 pages to the Clerk with a recommendation for full council action. We PDF and post any document modified during the committee process on the Legislative Information System.
* About 10,000 pages pass per Council.
* After each meeting, but prior to the next meeting, the Clerk’s Office synthesizes this information into a Journal of Proceedings that is approximately 2,000-3,000 pages.
* The Journal of Proceedings is then used as the raw material for the codification process.

#### Boston, Massachussetts: Navigating the Data

With so much open data being released often there is a question of what it means. For example, with permitting or health code violations how do we know what the letter of the law really is? How can we comply with something that is buried somewhere in a maze of government websites? A part of the picture is missing and that's where the legislation and other municipal code can help clear up the "what" and to answer questions on the "why".

#### New York City: Finding and Submitting Legislative Information

* Legistar is not easily searchable. Keywords searches have varying rates of success and often you can't find a bill unless you type its exact number, including the phantom zero.
* Bills must still be submitted in paper form (4 copies of each). Given that digital versions of signatures are acceptable to sign onto and submit a bill, it would save time and trees to be able to submit electronic copies.
* Not all of the video for committee hearings are posted to legistar. Some are, some aren't.

#### Participatory Politics Foundation: The Demand for Better Government Data

Our previous non-profit project, OpenCongress.org, received up to 27 million web visits to official information about bills in Congress. The popularity of OpenCongress demonstrated there is a massive public demand for authoritative information about legislation, to track and share it with peers. When legislative data is made fully open to the public, developers and government watchdogs can make user-friendly, powerful web tools that connect communities to what’s happening in local government. One example is the open-source ChicagoCouncilmatic, which enables users to subscribe to email alerts and RSS feeds for legislative actions and provides more-accessible bill summaries for wider understanding.

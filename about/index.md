## About

The Free Law Founders is a coalition of leaders from New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Washington, DC working to open government processes and information to scrutiny, collaboration, and innovation. 

### Declaration of Independence of Law

“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,” that laws are “wholesome and necessary for the public good,” that ignorantia juris non excusat “is a maxim of universal application that every man is presumed to know the law, and it would seem inherent that freedom of access to the laws, or the official interpretation of those laws, should be co-extensive with the sweep of the maxim. Knowledge is the only just condition of obedience,” that “such material as the laws and governmental rules and decisions must be freely available to the public and made known as widely as possible; hence there must be no restriction on the reproduction and dissemination of such documents.”

We believe that our system of government is no longer free for the governed to access in the method of our times. And we, the Free Law Founders, have come together to tackle this growing challenge to democracy in America the American way: with innovation, with collaboration, and with a firm belief that in our country, better is always possible.

###The Principles of Open Law & Open Legislation

Any citizen living in a Free Law community should be able to: 

1. Access Complete, Timely, Machine-Processable and Primary Laws, Legal Codes and Legislation on the Internet without facing restrictions, paywalls, fees, or burdensome user agreements. 

2. Download, share, annotate, and reuse that legal data in non-proprietary, open formats that are both license- and copyright-free.

3. See and participate in the lawmaking process on the Internet utilizing the latest open-source software, on their own time and on their own terms.

4. Freely engage with the law, and connect with their elected officials, other citizens and community stakeholders to collaboratively create and modify the laws when they want and how they want.

5. Expect that all those involved in lawmaking are committed to injecting innovation, iteration and improvement into their work.

### The Challenge 

The Free Law Founder Challenge
 
You can join the Free Law Founders Challenge: To create a one-stop shop website for legislatures to be more open, transparent, and tech-savvy before the year is out.
 
At their keynote speech “Hack The Law” at the MIT Media Lab Legal Hackathon online conference in June 2014, New York City Council Member Ben Kallos and San Francisco Supervisor Mark Farrell called on a nation of civic hackers to create a free and open source democracy platform for legislatures by next year.
 
The site will have five free and open source tools for:
 
·        Drafting legislation
·        Commenting on legislation
·        Making it available over open API
·        Opening up the law online
·        Authenticating the law
 
Government is due for an upgrade, and this challenge helps get us there. Legislatures can become the most transparent, efficient and connected versions of themselves, but only if we apply our collective ingenuity to the task.
